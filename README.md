# Advent Of Code in Nix

An exploration of nix the lang as I've only really used it to manage system deps for the odd dev shell.

## running

```sh
nix flake check --print-build-logs
```

Note this runs by building the checks output, so if nothing changes you won't see any output on the build.

## resources

Some useful looking resources.

- many other useful looking vids in the Nix Hour playlist
- tesing libs
  - [nix-unit - Unit testing for Nix code](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-unit) last update at time of writing last month
  - [nixt - Simple unit-testing for Nix](https://github.com/nix-community/nixt) last update at time of writing last year
  - both seem to be part of `nix-community` org
  - there is also [namaka - Snapshot testing for Nix based on haumea](https://github.com/nix-community/namaka) which might make sense as a workflow for wworking through the parsing parts but looks a bit more involved to set up.
- [noogle](https://noogle.dev/) function search for nix, try `lib.<???>` / `builtins.<???>`
